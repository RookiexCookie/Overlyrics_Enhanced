# Overlyrics (Taskbar Edition)

A fork of **Overlyrics**, redesigned to live seamlessly **inside the Windows taskbar** instead of floating above the desktop.

This edition places synchronized Spotify lyrics directly in the taskbar area ‚Äî centered, minimal, distraction‚Äëfree, and always on top.

## üîß Setup

1. Add your Spotify API Client ID to the script by setting the `CLIENT_ID` constant.
2. Ensure `REDIRECT_URI` in the script is registered in your Spotify Developer Dashboard.
3. Run the app:

```bash
python working.py
```

On first run the app may open a browser tab for authentication. Paste the auth code into the small Tkinter prompt when requested.

## üñ• Positioning Behavior

This fork positions the lyric window *inside the taskbar height* and centers it horizontally.  
Positioning code uses `QScreen.geometry()` (full screen) and `availableGeometry()` to calculate `taskbar_height`, then places the window so it overlaps into the taskbar area (no extra vertical space above desktop).

If your taskbar is on another monitor or docked differently, adjust the placement logic in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block.

## üõ† Notable Implementation Notes

- The hidden animation label is set to avoid expanding layout width to prevent right-shift drift.
- `window.adjustSize()` and `window.repaint()` are called before positioning to get correct dimensions.
- `self.setWindowFlag(Qt.WindowStaysOnTopHint, True)` and `self.show()` are called on lyric updates to keep the window on top.
- If Public Sans font isn't installed, the app falls back to Arial (see console warning).

---

## ‚ùó Known Issues & Tips

- If the window appears off-center, try resizing or toggling the taskbar auto-hide setting; the app attempts to calculate taskbar height but complex multi-monitor setups may need manual tweaks.
- Running the app as administrator may affect topmost behavior; generally no admin rights are required.
- On Linux or macOS, taskbar handling differs ‚Äî this fork is primarily targeted at Windows.
